# Lord-BEAN
Lord BEAN crafts shadow-drenched tracks that fuse the grit of underground hip-hop with the atmospheric pull of cinematic synths. Drawing from the haunting minimalism of BONES, the raw grit of $uicideboy$, the visceral intensity of CORPSE, and the moody allure of The Weeknd, his sound is both hypnotic and hard-hitting.
